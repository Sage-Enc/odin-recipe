    <h1>White Sauce Pasta</h1>
    
    <img src="../img/alfredo.jpg" alt="White Sauce Pasta" width="50%">

    <p>This white sauce is also known as béchamel sauce and has it’s origin in French cuisine.</p>>
    <p>Classic béchamel sauce is made with butter, flour and milk. For this pasta, I add little cream and little cheese to make it extra creamy, so you can say that this sauce is kind of a mix between alfredo and béchamel. But you can totally skip the cream and cheese and stick with milk only to make the classic version.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Chilli Flakes</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Veggies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 150 grams of pasta according to instructions on the package.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies –
            <ul>
                <li>1 small red onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium red pepper, sliced</li>
                <li>3/4 cup small broccoli florets</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sweet corn (frozen corn which I added to hot water for 5 minutes before using)</li>
            </ul>        
        </li>
        <li>Cook the veggies for 2 minutes. They should remain crunchy. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove veggies onto a plate.</li>
        <li>To another pan or you can use the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Then add in 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of flour.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You don’t have to brown the flour much.</li>
        <li>Then add in 2 cups of milk. You can also add 1/4 cup heavy cream here or use additional 1/4 cup milk.</li>
        <li>Mix everything using a whisk so that there are no lumps formed.</li>
        <li>Add in the seasonings:
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasonings</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (to taste)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mix in everything and let the sauce simmer.</li>
        <li>Sauce will thicken as it simmers and in 4 to 5 minutes it will coat the back of the spoon. Turn heat to lowest.</li>
        <li>Add in the veggies and the boiled pasta.</li>
        <li>Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point. Serve warm!</li>
    </ol>
